# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a minimal viable product (MVP) of a "Buy Me a Coffee" Web3 decentralized application. The dapp allows users to send cryptocurrency tips (coffee purchases) to the contract owner on the Arbitrum network, with a simple and intuitive user interface. The smart contract is already implemented and provides core functionality for receiving tips, storing coffee purchases, and allowing the owner to withdraw funds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Wallet Connection

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to connect my Web3 wallet to the dapp, so that I can interact with the smart contract and buy coffee.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the dapp THEN the system SHALL display a prominent wallet connection button
2. WHEN a user clicks the connect wallet button THEN the system SHALL show available wallet options using RainbowKit
3. WHEN a user successfully connects their wallet THEN the system SHALL display their connected address and network status
4. WHEN a user is on the wrong network THEN the system SHALL prompt them to switch to Arbitrum or Arbitrum Sepolia
5. WHEN a user disconnects their wallet THEN the system SHALL return to the initial connection state

### Requirement 2: Coffee Purchase Interface

**User Story:** As a connected user, I want to buy coffee with different sizes and leave a message, so that I can support the creator and share my thoughts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is connected THEN the system SHALL display a coffee purchase form with size options
2. WHEN a user selects a coffee size THEN the system SHALL show the corresponding ETH amount (Small: 0.001 ETH, Medium: 0.003 ETH, Large: 0.005 ETH)
3. WHEN a user enters their name THEN the system SHALL validate that the name is not empty
4. WHEN a user enters a message THEN the system SHALL accept optional messages up to reasonable length
5. WHEN a user clicks "Buy Coffee" THEN the system SHALL initiate a blockchain transaction with the correct amount
6. WHEN a transaction is pending THEN the system SHALL show loading state and disable the form
7. WHEN a transaction succeeds THEN the system SHALL show success feedback and reset the form
8. WHEN a transaction fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3: Coffee History Display

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see recent coffee purchases and messages, so that I can see community support and engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display recent coffee purchases from the smart contract
2. WHEN displaying coffee purchases THEN the system SHALL show purchaser name, message, amount, and timestamp
3. WHEN there are no coffee purchases THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN new coffee is purchased THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the coffee list
5. WHEN there are many coffee purchases THEN the system SHALL display the most recent ones first
6. WHEN displaying timestamps THEN the system SHALL format them in a user-friendly format

### Requirement 4: Responsive Design and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the dapp to work seamlessly on desktop and mobile, so that I can use it regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dapp on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout that works on small screens
2. WHEN a user accesses the dapp on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize the available screen space effectively
3. WHEN the dapp loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, coffee-themed design with warm colors
4. WHEN users interact with buttons and forms THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback
5. WHEN the dapp is loading data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 5: Contract Integration and Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to properly integrate with the existing smart contract, so that all blockchain interactions work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dapp initializes THEN the system SHALL connect to the deployed BuyMeACoffee contract on Arbitrum
2. WHEN reading contract data THEN the system SHALL use the correct contract ABI and address
3. WHEN calling contract functions THEN the system SHALL handle gas estimation and transaction errors gracefully
4. WHEN contract events are emitted THEN the system SHALL update the UI accordingly
5. WHEN the contract address or ABI changes THEN the system SHALL use a configuration file for easy updates
6. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback to users

### Requirement 6: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dapp to load quickly and respond smoothly, so that I have a pleasant experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dapp loads THEN the system SHALL minimize initial bundle size and load times
2. WHEN fetching blockchain data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies
3. WHEN users navigate the dapp THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and interactions
4. WHEN multiple users are active THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent usage efficiently
5. WHEN blockchain calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks

### Requirement 7: Security and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a user, I want my interactions with the dapp to be secure and follow Web3 best practices, so that my funds and data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users connect wallets THEN the system SHALL only request necessary permissions
2. WHEN handling user input THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs
3. WHEN displaying transaction data THEN the system SHALL show clear information about what users are signing
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information in error messages
5. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL not store private keys or sensitive information locally
6. WHEN making contract calls THEN the system SHALL use proper error handling and user confirmation flows
